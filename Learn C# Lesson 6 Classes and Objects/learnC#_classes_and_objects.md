# Lesson: Classes and Objects

This series of lessons looks at how classes and objects are used to represent data that looks and behaves more like information in the real world. For instance, creating on object with features such as size, colour and other properties.

# Lesson: Basic Classes and Objects

This lesson explored classes and objects and covered the following concepts:
- Define a **class**
- Instantiate an object using **new**
- Define **fields**, the pieces of data for each class
- Define **properties**, the spokespeople for each field
- Define **automatic properties**, the shorthand for making properties
- Define **methods**, the actions a class can take
- Define **constructors**, the special methods called when a class is instantiated
- Overload **constructors** and reuse code with this
- Control access to class members using **public** and **private**
