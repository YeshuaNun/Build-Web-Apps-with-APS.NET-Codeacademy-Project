# Lesson: Arrays and Loops

This series of lessons focuses on how C# uses arrays to store a collection of values that all share a common data type.

# Lesson: Arrays

This lesson focused on how to build, access, and edit values in arrays. It also introduced how to use some built-in methods for arrays.

# Lesson: Loops

Some notes on the different types of loops:
In general,

- **while** loops are good when you know your stopping condition, but not when you know how many times you want a program to loop or if you have a specific collection to loop through.
- **do...while** loops are only necessary if you definitely want something to run once, but then stop if a condition is met.
- **for** loops are best if you want something to run a specific number of times, rather than given a certain condition.
- **foreach** loops are the best way to loop over an array, or any other collection.

This lesson focused on the use of loops. It explored fours types of loops available when using C#. It also explored how to use break, continue, and return with loops.
