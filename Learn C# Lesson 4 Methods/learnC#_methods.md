# Lesson: Methods

The focus of this lesson is how to create a method which is a reuseable set of instructions. Some may refer to these as functions. Methods help keep code organized, maintainable, and repeatable.

# Lesson: Method Calls and Input

This lesson focused on how to call methods. It then looked at how to define bespoke methods with and without arguements, also by dealing with default arguements.

The end of the lesson looked at method overloading. This is where we can define several methods with the same name, but depending on their arguements, may change the way the method operates.
