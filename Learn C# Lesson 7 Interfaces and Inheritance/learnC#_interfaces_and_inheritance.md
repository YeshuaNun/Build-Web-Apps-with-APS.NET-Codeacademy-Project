# Lesson: Interfaces and Inheritance

This series of lesson begins by looking at interfaces. This is a form of contract that defines a set of methods, properties, events, and indexers that a class or struct must implement.

# Lesson: Interfaces

This lesson introduced the concept of **interfaces**. It showed how:
- Learned that interfaces are useful to guarantee certain functionality across multiple classes
- Built an interface using the interface keyword
- Defined properties and methods (but not constructors or fields) in the interface
- Built classes that implemented the interface
- Added members to the classes that werenâ€™t specified in the interface
